# C CPP Coding Rules
 C/C++ Coding Rules

Files/Modules
=============

The module name is done in CammelCase. 

Example: `LcdDriver`
- Header-File: `lcddriver.h`
- C-File/CPP-File: `lcddriver.c` / `lcddriver.cpp`

Disclaimer
----------

The disclaimer is started with `/**` and starts with ` ** ` for each new line and is ending with ` */`

It is allowed after `/**` and before ` */` to add a line with `******`.

Example:
````

File-Information
----------------

The file has to contain a file description with a short information about the file.

The complete module documentation is done in the .h file.

Example:
````
/**
 *******************************************************************************
 ** \file mymodule.c
 **
 ** This is my module
 ** A detailed description is available at
 ** @link MyModuleGroup file description @endlink
 **
 ** History:
